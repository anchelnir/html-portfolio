<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Hi, I’m John Doe, a Product Manager with a passion for turning complex ideas into intuitive digital experiences. Over the past few years, I’ve worked across startups and tech companies, leading cross-functional teams to deliver products that blend user needs with business impact. I thrive at the intersection of data, design, and strategy — building not just features, but scalable solutions that make a difference. When I’m not deep in product roadmaps, you’ll find me exploring new cities, reading about behavioral economics, or experimenting with AI tools just for fun.
